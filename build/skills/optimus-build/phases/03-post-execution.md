# Phase 3 (Post-Execution): Test Gaps, Summary, Commit, Push

Loaded by `SKILL.md` after Phase 2 finishes. After implementation and review
complete, finalize the task.

## Step 3.1: Test Gap Cross-Reference

Review any test gaps identified during implementation:

1. **Search future tasks** in the tasks file to check if the test is planned for a later task
2. **If planned in a future task (T-XXX):**
   - Inform the user: "Test for [scenario] is planned in T-XXX: [task title]"
   - Provide your opinion on timing: should it be created now or deferred?
   - Ask via `AskUser`: "Do you want to anticipate this test in the current task, or keep it for T-XXX?"
3. **If NOT planned in any future task:**
   - Flag as a gap and recommend adding the test to the current task
4. Do NOT silently skip test gaps because they might be covered later — always verify and ask

## Step 3.2: Present Final Summary

Present a structured summary including:
- Task ID and title
- Files created and modified
- Tests added
- Subtask execution results (X/N completed, tests passing)
- Spec compliance: X/Y acceptance criteria PASS (table with Criterion, Status, Notes)
- Code review findings summary (fixed, skipped)
- Convergence loop result:
  - Rounds dispatched (round 1 + convergence rounds): X
  - Status: CONVERGED | USER_STOPPED | SKIPPED | HARD_LIMIT | DISPATCH_FAILED_ABORTED
- Decisions made during questioning and review phases

## Step 3.3: Commit

Only after explicit user approval:

1. Run `git status` and `git diff --stat` to review
2. Run `git diff` to check for sensitive data (secrets, keys, tokens)
3. If clean, stage all relevant files and commit with a descriptive message
4. Run `git status` to confirm the commit succeeded

## Step 3.4: Push Commits (optional)

Offer to push commits — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Push Commits.

On completion, clear the iTerm2 marker:

```bash
_optimus_clear_session() {
  [ "$LC_TERMINAL" = "iTerm2" ] || [ "$TERM_PROGRAM" = "iTerm.app" ] || return 0
  local pid="$PPID" target_tty=""
  for _ in 1 2 3 4; do
    [ -z "$pid" ] || [ "$pid" = "1" ] && break
    target_tty=$(ps -o tty= -p "$pid" 2>/dev/null | tr -d ' ')
    case "$target_tty" in
      ""|"?"|"??") pid=$(ps -o ppid= -p "$pid" 2>/dev/null | tr -d ' '); target_tty="" ;;
      *) break ;;
    esac
  done
  _optimus_emit_clear() {
    if [ -n "$target_tty" ] && [ -w "/dev/$target_tty" ]; then
      printf '%s' "$1" > "/dev/$target_tty" 2>/dev/null || printf '%s' "$1"
    else
      printf '%s' "$1"
    fi
  }
  _optimus_emit_clear "$(printf '\e]1337;SetBadgeFormat=\a')"
  _optimus_emit_clear "$(printf '\e]6;1;bg;*;default\a')"
}
_optimus_clear_session
```
