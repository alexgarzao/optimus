# Pre-Task Validator

Validates a task specification against project docs BEFORE code generation begins.
Catches gaps, contradictions, and ambiguities that would cause rework.

---

## Phase 1: Discover and Load Context

### Step 1.0: Verify GitHub CLI (HARD BLOCK)

**HARD BLOCK:** Verify GitHub CLI — see AGENTS.md Protocol: GitHub CLI Check.

**Why check here:** Stage-1 dispatches ring droids (Step 2.4) that may use `gh`, and
subsequent stages (2-5) all require `gh`. Failing early prevents the user from completing
spec validation only to discover `gh` is not set up when they try to run Stage-2.

### Step 1.0.1: Find and Validate tasks.md

**HARD BLOCK:** Find and validate tasks.md — see AGENTS.md Protocol: tasks.md Validation.

### Step 1.0.2: Identify Task to Validate

**If the user specified a task ID** (e.g., "validate T-006"):
- Use the provided task ID
- Confirm with the user using `AskUser`: "I'll validate task T-006: [task title]. Correct?"

**If the user did NOT specify a task ID** (e.g., "validate the next task", or just invoked the skill):
1. **Identify the next eligible task:** Read state.json and scan for the first task that:
   - Has status `Pendente` (no entry in state.json) or `Validando Spec` (re-execution)
   - Has all dependencies (Depends column from tasks.md) with status `DONE` in state.json (or Depends is `-`)
   - **Version priority:** prefer tasks from the `Ativa` version first. If none found, try `Próxima`. If none found, pick from any version and warn the user: "No eligible tasks in the active version (<name>). Suggesting T-XXX from version '<other>'."
2. **If multiple candidates exist in the same version priority**, pick the one with highest Priority (`Alta` > `Media` > `Baixa`), then lowest ID
3. **Suggest to the user** using `AskUser`: "I identified the next task to validate: T-XXX — [task title]. Is this correct, or would you like to validate a different task?"
4. **If no eligible tasks exist**, ask the user to provide a task ID

**BLOCKING**: Do NOT proceed until the user confirms which task to validate.

### Step 1.0.2.1: Check Session State

Execute session state protocol — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Session State. Use stage=`plan`, status=`Validando Spec`.

Set terminal title — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Terminal Identification. Use stage=`plan`.

**On stage completion** (after Phase 7 Re-run Guard resolves to advance): delete the session file and restore terminal title.

### Step 1.0.3: Validate Task Status (DO NOT modify yet)

**HARD BLOCK:** This step is mandatory. Do NOT skip it.

1. Read `tasks.md` and find the row for the confirmed task ID
2. Read the task's status from state.json — see AGENTS.md Protocol: State Management.
   - If status is `Pendente` (or no entry) → proceed
   - If status is `Validando Spec` → proceed (re-execution of this stage)
   - If status is anything else → **STOP** and tell the user:
     ```
     Task T-XXX is in '<current_status>'. To run plan,
     it must be in 'Pendente' or 'Validando Spec'. This task has already moved past this stage.
     ```
3. **Check dependencies (HARD BLOCK):** Read the Depends column for this task from tasks.md.
   - If Depends is `-` → proceed (no dependencies)
   - For each dependency ID listed, read its status from state.json:
     - If ALL dependencies have status `DONE` → proceed
     - If ANY dependency is NOT `DONE`:
       - Invoke notification hooks (event=`task-blocked`) — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Notification Hooks.
       - If the dependency has status `Cancelado` → **STOP**: `"T-YYY was cancelled (Cancelado). Consider removing this dependency via /optimus-tasks."`
       - Otherwise → **STOP**: `"Task T-XXX depends on T-YYY (status: '<status>'). T-YYY must be DONE first."`
3.1. **Active version guard:** Check active version guard — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Active Version Guard.
4. **Expanded confirmation before status change:**
   - **If status will change** (current status is NOT `Validando Spec`) AND the user did NOT specify the task ID explicitly (auto-detect):
     - Present to the user via `AskUser`:
       ```
       I'm about to change task T-XXX status from '<current>' to 'Validando Spec'.

       **T-XXX: [title]**
       **Version:** [version from table]

       Confirm status change?
       ```
     - **BLOCKING:** Do NOT change status until the user confirms
   - **If re-execution** (status is already `Validando Spec`) OR the user specified the task ID explicitly:
     - Skip expanded confirmation (user already has context)

**Anti-pulo:** This agent accepts tasks in `Pendente` or `Validando Spec` (re-execution) status. If a task is in any other status (`Em Andamento`, `Validando Impl`, `DONE`, `Cancelado`), refuse to proceed — the task has already passed this stage or was cancelled.

### Step 1.0.4: Detect and Clean Abandoned Workspaces

**ALWAYS run this step** — regardless of task status. This detects orphaned workspaces
from a previous run that was interrupted (crash, user closed terminal, etc.).

1. Check if any branch or worktree already exists for this task:
   ```bash
   # Check for any branch matching the task ID
   git branch --list "*<task-id>*" 2>/dev/null
   # Check for any worktree matching the task ID
   git worktree list | grep -iF "<task-id>"
   ```
2. Also read the `branch` field from state.json if available.
3. **If a branch or worktree exists:**
   - Ask via `AskUser`:
     ```
     Task T-XXX has an existing workspace from a previous run:
       Branch: <branch>
       Worktree: <path> (if applicable)
       Status in state.json: <current-status>

     What should I do?
     ```
     Options:
     - **Reuse** — switch to the existing workspace and continue from where it left off
     - **Clean and recreate** — delete the old workspace and create a fresh one
     - **Clean and reset to Pendente** — delete the workspace and reset the task (abandon)

   If the user chooses **Reuse**:
   - If a worktree exists, change working directory to it and proceed to Step 1.0.6
   - If only a branch exists (no worktree), create a worktree for it and proceed to Step 1.0.6

   If the user chooses **Clean and recreate**:
   1. Remove worktree if exists: `git worktree remove <path>`
   2. Delete branch: `git branch -D <branch>` and `git push origin --delete <branch>` (if pushed)
   3. Continue to Step 1.0.5 (will create fresh workspace)

   If the user chooses **Clean and reset to Pendente**:
   1. Remove worktree if exists: `git worktree remove <path>`
   2. Delete branch: `git branch -D <branch>` and `git push origin --delete <branch>` (if pushed)
   3. Remove the task entry from state.json (resets to Pendente)
   4. **STOP** — task is back to Pendente, user can re-run stage-1 when ready

4. **If no branch or worktree exists** → proceed to Step 1.0.5

### Step 1.0.5: Reserve Task and Create Workspace

Follow shell safety guidelines — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Shell Safety Guidelines.

**If already on a feature branch** (not default/main/master): skip to Step 1.0.6
(check divergence — the task was already reserved in a previous run or by the user manually).

**If on the default branch:**

1. **Derive branch name** — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Branch Name Derivation.

2. **Update state.json:**
   Write status `Validando Spec` and the derived branch name to state.json — see
   AGENTS.md Protocol: State Management.

3. **Invoke notification hooks** (event=`status-change`) — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Notification Hooks.

4. **Create worktree:**
   ```bash
   REPO_NAME=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
   WORKTREE_DIR="../${REPO_NAME}-<task-id>-<keywords>"
   ```
   **Pre-check:** If `WORKTREE_DIR` already exists but is not a git worktree, ask via
   `AskUser`: "Directory `<path>` already exists but is not a git worktree."
   Options: Remove and create worktree / Rename existing directory / Cancel.
   ```bash
   git worktree add "$WORKTREE_DIR" -b "<tipo-prefix>/<task-id>-<keywords>"
   ```
   Then change working directory to the new worktree path for all subsequent steps.

5. **Rollback on failure:** If worktree creation fails:
   - Remove the entry from state.json
   - **STOP** and report the error to the user

**BLOCKING**: Do NOT proceed until the worktree is created.

### Step 1.0.6: Check tasks.md Divergence (warning)

Check tasks.md divergence — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Divergence Warning.

### Step 1.0.7: Increment Stage Stats

Increment stage stats — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Increment Stage Stats. Use counter=`plan_runs`, timestamp=`last_plan`.

### Step 1.1: Discover Project Structure

Before loading docs, discover the project's structure:

1. **Identify stack:** Check for `go.mod`, `package.json`, `Makefile`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.
2. **Identify test commands:** Look in `Makefile`, `package.json` scripts, or CI config for lint, test, and integration test commands. These are needed for DoD validation.
3. **Identify project rules and AI instructions (MANDATORY):** Execute project rules discovery — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Project Rules Discovery.

4. **Identify reference docs:** Look for task specs, API design, data model, architecture docs, business requirements, and dependency maps.
5. **Identify doc hierarchy:** Determine the source-of-truth ordering for conflicting docs (typically: project rules/AI instructions > API design > data model > architecture > business requirements > task specs).

### Step 1.2: Load Documents

Resolve TaskSpec — see AGENTS.md Protocol: TaskSpec Resolution. Load the Ring pre-dev
task spec for objective, acceptance criteria, API contracts, and data model.

Also load other project reference docs:
- API contracts
- DB schema / data model
- Technical architecture
- Business requirements
- Coding standards (source of truth)
- Dependency relationships

Ring pre-dev artifacts are the primary specification source.

### Step 1.3: Verify Existing Code

Check the codebase for:
- Are dependencies (required tasks) actually implemented?
- Do shared packages/interfaces referenced exist?
- Does the DB schema match the data model doc?
- Are there existing patterns to follow?

---

## Validation Dimensions

### 1. Spec Completeness
- Does the task have ALL required sections? (Scope, Success Criteria, Testing Strategy, Dependencies, Definition of Done)
- Are all fields/entities referenced actually defined in the data model?
- Are all endpoints referenced actually defined in the API contracts?
- Are all business rules explicitly stated (not implied)?

### 2. Cross-Doc Consistency
Check for contradictions BETWEEN docs using the discovered source-of-truth hierarchy:

- **Task spec vs API contracts**: HTTP methods, request/response formats, error codes, query params, field names
- **Task spec vs data model**: Column types, constraints (lengths, nullability, uniqueness), relationships
- **Task spec vs architecture**: Patterns, libraries, configuration values
- **Task spec vs business requirements**: Feature scope, user stories, acceptance criteria
- **API contracts vs data model**: Field names (API naming vs DB naming), types, nullable fields

### 3. Dependency Readiness
- Are ALL "Requires" tasks actually implemented and merged?
- Are DB tables/migrations that this task needs already created?
- Are shared packages/middleware this task depends on available?
- Are there circular dependencies with other tasks?

### 4. API Contract Completeness
For each endpoint in the task:
- Request format fully defined? (body, query params, path params, headers)
- Response format fully defined? (success + all error codes with HTTP status)
- Pagination format matches global convention?
- Authentication/authorization specified?
- Edge cases: empty body, missing fields, invalid types, boundary values

### 5. Test Coverage Gaps (MANDATORY)

This section is MANDATORY. You MUST analyze ALL three test types below and for EACH type either:
- List specific missing scenarios as gaps, OR
- Explicitly state "NONE — all code paths covered" with a brief justification listing the paths verified.

Skipping a test type or leaving it empty is NOT allowed.

#### 5a. Unit Test Gaps (REQUIRED)
For EACH function/method that the task will create or modify, verify:
- [ ] Happy path covered?
- [ ] Each validation rule has a corresponding test?
- [ ] Each error return path has a corresponding test?
- [ ] Boundary values tested (min, max, empty, nil, zero)?
- [ ] Each branch/condition in business logic has a test?

Enumerate every function and check each bullet. If ANY bullet is not covered, add it as a gap.

#### 5b. Integration Test Gaps (REQUIRED)
For EACH database operation that the task will create or modify, verify:
- [ ] CRUD cycle covered?
- [ ] Constraint violations tested (unique, FK, not null)?
- [ ] Data isolation tested (user A cannot see user B's data)?
- [ ] Pagination with real DB (first page, last page, beyond last page)?
- [ ] Sort/filter with real DB (each filter param, combined filters)?
- [ ] Edge cases: empty result set, single result, exact page boundary?

#### 5c. E2E Test Gaps (REQUIRED)
For EACH user-facing flow the task introduces, verify:
- [ ] Happy path covered (full flow from start to completion)?
- [ ] Each form field validation has a test?
- [ ] Error states covered (server error, network timeout, 4xx responses)?
- [ ] Navigation flows covered (create -> list -> detail -> edit -> delete)?
- [ ] Empty state (zero records) has a test?
- [ ] URL state persistence (query params survive refresh)?

#### 5d. Cross-Cutting Scenarios (REQUIRED)
For EACH of the following, verify if it applies to the task:
- [ ] Concurrent modifications (optimistic locking needed?)
- [ ] Large datasets (pagination boundary: last page, beyond last page)
- [ ] Special characters in text fields (unicode, injection via parameterized queries, XSS via framework escaping)
- [ ] Input truncation (fields exceeding length limits)
- [ ] Timezone handling (if dates are involved)

### 6. Definition of Done (DoD) Validation
Verify the task has a Definition of Done section with ALL required items:

**Required items (every task MUST have):**
- [ ] Code reviewed (specify reviewers as applicable)
- [ ] Tests passing with coverage threshold
- [ ] All verification commands passing (lint, unit tests, integration tests)
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)

**Validate DoD quality:**
- Are coverage thresholds specified and realistic?
- Does the DoD explicitly list the project's verification commands?
- Are reviewer roles appropriate for the task type?
- Does the DoD include ALL deliverables?
- Are there measurable criteria (not vague like "works correctly")?
- Does the DoD match the task's Testing Strategy?
- Compare with DoD from completed tasks to ensure consistency

### 7. Observability Gaps

Analyze whether the task has adequate logging and metrics coverage. Check existing codebase patterns and verify:

#### 7a. Logging Gaps (REQUIRED)
For EACH new component the task creates:
- [ ] Success operations logged? (with entity IDs, operation name)
- [ ] Error paths logged? (with error message, context IDs)
- [ ] Security-relevant events logged? (auth failures, rate limits, suspicious input)
- [ ] Async/background operations logged? (start/end with duration, items processed)
- [ ] Sensitive data excluded from logs? (no passwords, tokens, PII)

Cross-cutting:
- [ ] Slow query logging exists?
- [ ] Server lifecycle logging exists?
- [ ] External service calls logged?

#### 7b. Metrics Gaps (REQUIRED)
Check if the task should emit structured fields that enable metrics:
- [ ] Operation counters?
- [ ] Duration tracking for batch/external operations?
- [ ] Error counters by type?
- [ ] Business KPIs relevant to the feature?

### 8. Implementability Check
- Can a developer implement each item WITHOUT asking questions?
- Are UI wireframes/designs referenced or described enough?
- Are external API contracts documented?
- Are feature flags or gradual rollout needed?
- Are there performance requirements with measurable thresholds?

---

## Phase 2: Execution

### Step 2.1: Cross-Reference
For EACH item in the task spec, verify it exists and is consistent in the reference docs.
Flag any item that:
- Exists in the task spec but NOT in API contracts or data model
- Has different values between docs (field type, HTTP method, error code)
- References something that doesn't exist yet (table, endpoint, component)

### Step 2.2: Analyze Test Gaps (MANDATORY — do NOT skip)
For EACH test type (unit, integration, E2E):
1. List every function/method/flow the task will create or modify
2. For each one, check every bullet from Dimension 5
3. For each uncovered bullet, add a row to the Test Coverage Gaps table
4. If all bullets are covered, write "NONE — verified: [list functions/flows checked]"

You MUST produce output for all 4 sub-sections (5a, 5b, 5c, 5d).

### Step 2.2.1: Cross-Reference Test Gaps with Future Tasks (MANDATORY)
For EACH test gap identified in Step 2.2:
1. **Search future tasks:** Scan the tasks file for any task that explicitly covers the missing test scenario (look for test-related acceptance criteria, testing strategy sections, or test IDs that match the gap)
2. **Classify each gap:**
   - **NOT PLANNED** — no future task covers this test. Flag as a gap in the current task.
   - **PLANNED IN T-XXX** — a future task explicitly includes this test. Note which task and what it covers.
3. **For gaps planned in future tasks**, evaluate and present to the user:
   - **Which future task** covers it (task ID and title)
   - **Opinion on timing:** Should the test be created now or is it reasonable to defer? Consider:
     - Does the current task introduce the code path that needs testing? If yes, recommend testing now.
     - Is the future task a dedicated testing task? If yes, deferring may be acceptable.
     - Does the gap create a risk window (untested code in production between tasks)?
   - **Ask the user** via `AskUser`: "Test gap [description] is planned for T-XXX. I recommend [now/deferring] because [reason]. Do you want to add this test to the current task?"

Add a column to the Test Coverage Gaps table:

```
| # | Type | Scenario Missing | Priority | Future Task | Recommendation |
|---|------|------------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Unit | Error path for X  | HIGH     | NOT PLANNED | Add to current task |
| 2 | Integration | Pagination edge case | MEDIUM | T-015 | Defer — dedicated test task |
| 3 | E2E | Empty state flow | HIGH | T-018 | Anticipate — current task creates this flow |
```

### Step 2.3: Analyze Observability Gaps (MANDATORY — do NOT skip)
For EACH new component:
1. Check existing logging patterns in the codebase
2. Verify new components follow them
3. Flag missing logs and missing structured fields for metrics

### Step 2.4: Dispatch Validation Agents (MANDATORY)

**HARD BLOCK:** Dispatch specialist ring droids in parallel to validate the task spec. Each agent receives file paths and can navigate the codebase autonomously.

**Ring droids are REQUIRED** — verify ring droids — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Ring Droid Requirement Check. **If any of the droids below are not available, STOP and inform the user:**
```
Required ring droids are not installed. Install them before running this skill:
  - ring-default-business-logic-reviewer
  - ring-default-security-reviewer
  - ring-dev-team-qa-analyst
  - ring-default-code-reviewer
```

**Droids to dispatch:**

1. `ring-default-business-logic-reviewer` — validate business rules completeness, edge cases, and domain correctness in the task spec
2. `ring-default-security-reviewer` — identify security gaps in the spec (missing auth, input validation, data exposure risks)
3. `ring-dev-team-qa-analyst` — validate testing strategy completeness, identify untested scenarios
4. `ring-default-code-reviewer` — assess architectural feasibility, identify patterns that may conflict with the codebase

**Agent prompt MUST include:**
```
Goal: Pre-implementation validation of task T-XXX — [your domain]

Context:
  - Project root: <absolute path to project worktree>
  - Task spec: <TASKS_DIR>/<TaskSpec> (READ this file)
  - Subtasks dir: <TASKS_DIR>/subtasks/T-XXX/ (READ all .md files if dir exists)
  - Reference docs dir: <TASKS_DIR>/ (explore for PRD, TRD, API design, data model)
  - Project rules: AGENTS.md, PROJECT_RULES.md, docs/PROJECT_RULES.md (READ all that exist)
  - Gaps already identified: [list from Steps 2.1-2.3]

IMPORTANT: You have access to Read, Grep, and Glob tools. USE THEM to:
  - Read files at the paths above
  - Search the codebase for patterns similar to what the spec describes
  - Find how similar features were implemented in the project
  - Discover existing test patterns, error handling conventions, and architectural styles
  - Explore related files not listed above when needed for context

Your job:
  Validate the task spec from your domain perspective BEFORE implementation.
  Identify risks, gaps, contradictions, or missing requirements.
  Report findings ONLY — do NOT generate code.

Required output:
  For each finding: severity, category, description, recommendation
  If no issues: "PASS — [domain] validation clean"

Cross-cutting analysis (MANDATORY for all agents):
  1. What would break in production under load if this spec is implemented as-is?
  2. What's MISSING from the spec that should be there? (not just what's wrong)
  3. Does this spec trace back to business requirements? Flag orphan requirements
  4. How would a new developer understand and implement this spec 6 months from now?
  5. Search the codebase for how similar features were built — flag inconsistencies with existing patterns
```

**Special Instructions per Agent:**

Include per-droid quality checklists — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Per-Droid Quality Checklists.
Adapt checklist items to spec validation context (e.g., "verify X exists in spec" instead of
"verify X is implemented in code").

**QA agent** (`ring-dev-team-qa-analyst`) must additionally (beyond the protocol):
- Spec quality: are ACs measurable and testable? (not vague like "works correctly")
- Does each AC specify both success AND failure behavior?
- Rollback/recovery strategy defined for failure cases
- Can a developer implement each item WITHOUT asking questions?

Merge agent findings with the findings from Steps 2.1-2.3. Deduplicate and sort by severity before presenting.

## Phase 3: Present and Resolve Findings

### Step 3.1: Present Summary, then Walk Through Each Finding

1. **Announce total findings count:** Display `"### Total findings to review: N"` prominently before presenting the first finding
2. **Present the summary report** (tables from Output Format) for bird's-eye view
3. **Then present findings ONE AT A TIME** in priority order: contradictions > missing specs > test gaps > observability > DoD > ambiguities

**For EACH finding**, present with `"(X/N)"` progress prefix in the header:

#### Deep Research Before Presenting (MANDATORY)

Execute deep research before presenting each finding — see AGENTS.md "Common Patterns > Deep Research Before Presenting". All 12 checklist items apply.

#### Present the Finding

- **Problem:** Clear description, referencing exact doc locations
- **Why it matters:** Impact analysis through four lenses:
  - **UX:** How does this affect the end user?
  - **Task focus:** Within task scope or tangential?
  - **Project focus:** MVP-critical or gold-plating?
  - **Engineering quality:** Maintainability, testability, reliability impact

#### Proposed Solutions (2-3 options)

Present 2-3 options using the format from AGENTS.md "Common Patterns > Finding Option Format".

#### Collect Decision

   **AskUser `[topic]` format:** Format: `(X/N) F#-Category`.
   Example: `[topic] (8/12) F8-DeadCode`.

4. Use `AskUser` tool. **BLOCKING**: Do NOT advance to the next finding until the user decides.
   **Every AskUser MUST include these options:**
   - One option per proposed solution (Option A, Option B, Option C, etc.)
   - Skip — no action
   - Tell me more — if selected, STOP and answer immediately (do NOT continue to next finding)
5. **IMMEDIATE RESPONSE RULE** — see AGENTS.md "Finding Presentation" item 9. If the user
   selects "Tell me more" or responds with free text: STOP, research and answer RIGHT NOW.
   **NEVER defer to the end of the findings loop.**
6. **Track all decisions** internally. Do NOT apply any fix yet — all fixes are applied in Phase 4.

## Phase 4: Apply Approved Corrections

### Step 4.1: Apply ALL Approved Corrections

After the user has responded to ALL findings:
1. Present a pre-apply summary listing every change grouped by file
2. Apply ALL approved changes to the docs in a single pass
3. Present a final summary of what was changed vs skipped/rejected

## Phase 5: Commit Changes

### Step 5.1: Commit Changes (if any modifications were made)

If any corrections were applied in Phase 4:
1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to review all changes
2. Check for sensitive data (secrets, keys, tokens) — if found, STOP and warn the user
3. Present the summary of changes and ask the user for commit approval via `AskUser`
4. If approved, stage all modified files and commit using the task's Tipo for the conventional commit prefix (Feature→`feat`, Fix→`fix`, Refactor→`refactor`, Chore→`chore`, Docs→`docs`, Test→`test`). Example: `feat(T-003): fix spec — [brief summary of corrections]`
5. Run `git status` to confirm the commit succeeded

If no corrections were applied (all findings skipped), skip this step.

## Phase 6: Convergence Loop

### Step 6.1: Convergence Loop (MANDATORY)

Execute the convergence loop — see AGENTS.md "Common Patterns > Convergence Loop".

**Stage-specific scope for convergence rounds 2+:**
Dispatch the **same 4 droids** from Step 2.4 (business-logic-reviewer, security-reviewer,
qa-analyst, code-reviewer). Each agent receives file paths to task spec, reference docs,
tasks.md, and project rules (re-read fresh from disk). Do NOT include the findings ledger
in agent prompts — the orchestrator handles dedup using strict matching (same file + same
line range ±5 + same category).

Include analysis instructions: cross-reference (Step 2.1), test gaps (Step 2.2),
observability (Step 2.3), DoD, ambiguities. Include the cross-cutting analysis instructions
(same 5 items from Step 2.4 prompt).

**Failure handling:** If the fresh sub-agent dispatch fails (Task tool error, ring droid
unavailable), treat it as equivalent to "zero new findings" for that round but warn the
user. Do NOT fail the entire validation.

When the loop exits, proceed to Phase 7 (Re-run Guard).

## Phase 7: Re-run Guard

### Step 7.1: Evaluate Re-run or Advance

Execute re-run guard — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Re-run Guard.

- If the user chooses **Re-run with clean context**: go back to Step 1.1 (Discover Project
  Structure). Skip all prior setup steps (GitHub CLI check, tasks.md validation, task
  identification, session state, status validation, workspace creation, divergence check).
  Increment stage stats before re-starting analysis.
- If the user chooses **Advance** (or 0 findings): proceed to Phase 8 (Push).

## Phase 8: Push Commits

### Step 8.1: Push Commits (optional)

Offer to push commits — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Push Commits.

---

## Rules
- Do NOT generate code — this is analysis only
- Do NOT assume — if something is ambiguous, flag it
- ALWAYS check both happy path AND error paths
- Prioritize findings: contradictions > missing specs > test gaps > observability gaps > DoD issues > ambiguities
- Reference exact file locations when citing docs
- Test Coverage Gaps (Dimension 5) is MANDATORY and MUST enumerate gaps for ALL three test types plus cross-cutting scenarios
- Observability Gaps (Dimension 7) is MANDATORY. Check existing codebase logging patterns and verify new components follow them
- ALWAYS use the two-phase flow: Phase 1 presents summary then walks through each finding one at a time. Phase 2 applies all approved corrections at once
- If corrections were applied, ask the user for commit approval — do NOT commit without explicit approval
- Every finding must reference a specific doc section or standard — "I would do it differently" is not a valid finding
- BEFORE presenting each finding: deep research is MANDATORY — project patterns, architectural decisions, existing codebase, task focus, user/consumer use cases, UX impact, API best practices, engineering best practices, language-specific idioms. Option A must be the correct approach backed by research evidence, regardless of effort
- The agent NEVER decides whether a finding should be fixed or skipped — the USER always decides
- ALL findings (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW) MUST be presented to the user for decision
- The agent may recommend an option, but MUST wait for user approval via AskUser before proceeding
- Do NOT auto-skip, auto-dismiss, or auto-resolve any finding regardless of severity
- **Re-run guard:** After the convergence loop exits, execute the Re-run Guard protocol
  (Phase 7) instead of unconditionally suggesting the next stage. The next stage is only
  suggested when the analysis produces 0 findings. See AGENTS.md Protocol: Re-run Guard.

### Dry-Run Mode
If the user requests a dry-run (e.g., "dry-run spec T-003", "preview spec"):
- Run ALL analysis phases (Phase 1, Validation Dimensions, Phase 2) normally
- Present ALL findings in Phase 3 (interactive resolution)
- **Do NOT change task status** — skip Step 1.0.5 (status reservation)
- **Do NOT create workspaces** — skip Step 1.0.5 (workspace creation)
- **Do NOT increment stats** — skip Step 1.0.7 (stage stats)
- **Do NOT commit, push, or re-run** — skip Phases 4, 5, 7, 8
- **Do NOT run convergence loop** — one pass is sufficient for preview
- Present results as informational: "what would happen" without side effects

<!-- INLINE-PROTOCOLS:START -->
## Shared Protocols (from AGENTS.md)

The following protocols are referenced by this skill. They are
extracted from the Optimus AGENTS.md to make this plugin self-contained.

### File Location

All Optimus files live in the `.optimus/` directory at the project root:

```
.optimus/
├── config.json          # versionado — tasksDir
├── tasks.md             # versionado — structural task data (NO status, NO branch)
├── state.json           # gitignored — operational state (status, branch per task)
├── stats.json           # gitignored — stage execution counters per task
├── sessions/            # gitignored — session state for crash recovery
└── reports/             # gitignored — exported reports
```

**Configuration** is stored in `.optimus/config.json`:

```json
{
  "tasksDir": "docs/pre-dev"
}
```

- **`tasksDir`**: Path to the Ring pre-dev artifacts root. Default: `docs/pre-dev`.
  The import and stage agents look for task specs at `<tasksDir>/tasks/` and subtasks
  at `<tasksDir>/subtasks/`.

**Tasks file** is always `.optimus/tasks.md` — not configurable.

**Operational state** is stored in `.optimus/state.json` (gitignored):

```json
{
  "T-001": { "status": "DONE", "branch": "feat/t-001-setup-auth", "updated_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z" },
  "T-003": { "status": "Em Andamento", "branch": "feat/t-003-user-registration", "updated_at": "2025-01-16T14:00:00Z" }
}
```

- Each key is a task ID. A task with no entry is `Pendente` (implicit default).
- `status`: current pipeline stage (see Valid Status Values).
- `branch`: the derived branch name, stored for quick reference (always re-derivable).
- Stage agents read and write this file — never tasks.md — for status changes.
- If state.json is lost, status can be reconstructed: task with a worktree = in progress,
  without = Pendente. The agent asks the user to confirm before proceeding.

**Stage execution stats** are stored in `.optimus/stats.json` (gitignored):

```json
{
  "T-001": { "plan_runs": 2, "review_runs": 3, "last_plan": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z", "last_review": "2025-01-16T14:00:00Z" },
  "T-002": { "plan_runs": 1, "review_runs": 0 }
}
```

- Each key is a task ID. Values track how many times `plan` and `review` executed on the task.
- A high `plan_runs` signals unclear or problematic specs. A high `review_runs` signals
  complex review cycles or specification gaps.
- The file is created on first use by `plan` or `review`. If missing, agents treat all
  counters as 0.
- `report` reads this file to display churn metrics.

Agents resolve paths:
1. **Read `.optimus/config.json`** for `tasksDir`. Fallback: `docs/pre-dev`.
2. **Tasks file:** `.optimus/tasks.md` (fixed path).
3. **If tasks.md not found:** **STOP** and suggest running `import` to create one.

The `.optimus/state.json`, `.optimus/stats.json`, `.optimus/sessions/`, and
`.optimus/reports/` are gitignored (operational/temporary state).
The `.optimus/config.json` and `.optimus/tasks.md` are versioned (structural data).


### Valid Status Values (stored in state.json)

Status lives in `.optimus/state.json`, NOT in tasks.md. A task with no entry in
state.json is implicitly `Pendente`.

| Status | Set by | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `Pendente` | Initial (implicit) | Not started — no entry in state.json |
| `Validando Spec` | plan | Spec being validated |
| `Em Andamento` | build | Implementation in progress |
| `Validando Impl` | review | Implementation being reviewed |
| `DONE` | done | Completed |
| `Cancelado` | tasks, done | Task abandoned, will not be implemented |

**Administrative status operations** (managed by tasks, not by stage agents):
- **Reopen:** `DONE` → `Pendente` (remove entry from state.json) or `Em Andamento` (if worktree exists) — when a bug is found after close. Also accepts `Cancelado` → `Pendente` — when a cancellation decision is reversed.
- **Advance:** move forward one stage — when work was done manually outside the pipeline
- **Demote:** move backward one stage — when rework is needed after review
- **Cancel:** any non-terminal → `Cancelado` — task will not be implemented

These operations require explicit user confirmation.


### Task Spec Resolution

Every task MUST have a Ring pre-dev reference in the `TaskSpec` column. Stage agents
(plan, build, check) resolve the full path as `<tasksDir>/<TaskSpec>` and read the
referenced file for objective, acceptance criteria, and implementation details.

The subtasks directory is derived automatically from the TaskSpec path:
- TaskSpec: `tasks/task_001.md` → Subtasks: `<tasksDir>/subtasks/T-001/`
- The `T-NNN` identifier is extracted from the task spec filename convention

Agents read objective and acceptance criteria directly from the Ring source files.
The tasks.md table only tracks structural data (dependencies, versions, priorities)
— it does NOT duplicate content from Ring.


### Format Validation

Every stage agent (1-4) MUST validate the tasks.md format before operating:
1. **First line** is `<!-- optimus:tasks-v1 -->` (format marker)
2. A `## Versions` section exists with a table containing columns: Version, Status, Description
3. All Version Status values are valid (`Ativa`, `Próxima`, `Planejada`, `Backlog`, `Concluída`)
4. Exactly one version has Status `Ativa`
5. At most one version has Status `Próxima`
6. A markdown table exists with columns: ID, Title, Tipo, Depends, Priority, Version (Estimate and TaskSpec are optional — tables without them are still valid). **Status and Branch columns are NOT expected** — they live in state.json.
7. All task IDs follow the `T-NNN` pattern
8. All Tipo values are one of: `Feature`, `Fix`, `Refactor`, `Chore`, `Docs`, `Test`
9. All Depends values are either `-` or comma-separated valid task IDs that exist as rows in the tasks table (not just matching `T-NNN` pattern — the referenced task must actually exist)
10. All Priority values are one of: `Alta`, `Media`, `Baixa`
11. All Version values reference a version name that exists in the Versions table
12. No duplicate task IDs
13. No circular dependencies in the dependency graph (e.g., T-001 → T-002 → T-001)

If the format marker is missing or validation fails, the agent must **STOP** and suggest
running `/optimus-import` to fix the format. Do NOT attempt to interpret malformed data.

14. No unescaped pipe characters (`|`) in task titles (breaks markdown table parsing)
15. **Empty table handling:** If the tasks table exists but has zero data rows (only headers),
format validation PASSES. Stage agents (1-4) MUST check for this condition immediately after
format validation and before task identification. If zero data rows: **STOP** and inform the
user: "No tasks found in tasks.md. Use `/optimus-tasks` to create a task or `/optimus-import`
to import from Ring pre-dev." Do NOT proceed to task identification with an empty table.

**NOTE:** For circular dependency detection (item 13), trace the full dependency chain for
each task. If any task appears twice in the chain, a cycle exists. Report ALL tasks involved
in the cycle so the user can fix it with `/optimus-tasks`.


### Convergence Loop (Full Roster Model)
Applies to: plan, review, pr-check, coderabbit-review, deep-review, deep-doc-review

The convergence loop eliminates false convergence by dispatching the **same agent roster**
as round 1 in every subsequent round:
- **Round 1:** Orchestrator dispatches all specialist agents in parallel (with full session context)
- **Rounds 2-5:** The **same agent roster** as round 1 is dispatched in parallel via `Task`
  tool, each with zero prior context. Each agent reads all files fresh from disk.
- **Round 2 is MANDATORY** — the "zero new findings" stop condition only applies from round 3 onward
- **Sub-agents do NOT receive the findings ledger.** Dedup is performed entirely by the
  orchestrator after agents return, using **strict matching**: same file + same line range
  (±5 lines) + same category. "Description similarity" is NOT sufficient for dedup — the
  file, location, and category must all match.
- Stop only when: zero new findings (round 3+), round 5 reached, or user explicitly stops
- LOW severity findings are NOT a reason to stop — ALL findings are presented to the user

**Why full roster, not a single agent:** A single generalist agent structurally cannot
replicate the coverage of 8-10 domain specialists. The security-reviewer catches injection
risks a code-reviewer won't. The nil-safety-reviewer catches empty guards a QA analyst won't.
Dispatching a single agent in rounds 2+ creates false convergence — the agent declares
"zero new findings" because it lacks the domain depth, not because the code is clean.


### Deep Research Before Presenting (MANDATORY for cycle review skills)
Applies to: plan, review, pr-check, coderabbit-review

**BEFORE presenting any finding to the user, the agent MUST research it deeply.** This
research is done SILENTLY — do not show the research process. Present only the conclusions.

**Research checklist (ALL items, every finding):**

1. **Project patterns:** Read the affected file(s) fully. Check how similar cases are handled
   elsewhere in the codebase. Identify existing conventions the finding might violate or follow.
2. **Architectural decisions:** Review project rules (AGENTS.md, PROJECT_RULES.md, etc.) and
   architecture docs (TRD, ADRs). Understand WHY the project is structured this way before
   suggesting changes.
3. **Existing codebase:** Search for precedent. If the codebase already does the same thing
   in 10 other places without issue, that context changes the finding's weight.
4. **Current task focus:** Is this finding within the scope of the task being worked on?
   Tangential findings should be flagged as such (not dismissed, but contextualized).
5. **User/consumer use cases:** Who consumes this code — end users, other services, internal
   modules? How does the finding affect them? Trace the impact to real user scenarios.
6. **UX impact:** For user-facing changes, evaluate usability, accessibility, error messaging,
   and workflows. Would the user notice? Would it block their work?
7. **API best practices:** For API changes, check REST conventions, error handling patterns,
   idempotency, status codes, pagination, versioning, and backward compatibility.
8. **Engineering best practices:** SOLID principles, DRY, separation of concerns, error
   handling, resilience patterns, observability, testability.
9. **Language-specific best practices:** Use `WebSearch` to research idioms and conventions
   for the specific language (Go, TypeScript, Python, etc.). Check official style guides,
   common linter rules, and community-accepted patterns.
10. **Correctness over convenience:** Always recommend the correct approach, regardless of
    effort. The easy option may be presented as an alternative, but Option A must be what
    the agent believes is right based on all the research above.
11. **Production resilience:** Would this code survive production conditions? Consider:
    timeouts on external calls, retry with backoff, circuit breakers, graceful degradation,
    resource cleanup (connections, handles, goroutines), graceful shutdown, and behavior
    under load (N+1 queries, unbounded queries, connection pool exhaustion).
12. **Data integrity and privacy:** Are transaction boundaries correct? Could partial writes
    occur? Is PII properly handled (not logged, masked in responses)? LGPD/GDPR compliance?

**After research, form the recommendation:** Option A MUST be the approach the agent
believes is correct based on the research. It must be backed by evidence (project patterns,
best practice references, official documentation), not just a generic suggestion.


### Finding Option Format (MANDATORY for cycle review skills)

Every finding must present 2-3 options with this structure:

```
**Option A: [name] (RECOMMENDED)**
[Concrete steps — what to do, which files to change, what code to write]
- Why recommended: [reference to research — best practice, project pattern, official docs]
- Impact: [UX / Task focus / Project focus / Engineering quality]
- Effort: [low / medium / high / very high]
- Estimated time: [< 5 min / 5-15 min / 15-60 min / 1-4h / > 4h]

**Option B: [name]**
[Alternative approach]
- Impact: [UX / Task focus / Project focus / Engineering quality]
- Effort: [low / medium / high / very high]
- Estimated time: [< 5 min / 5-15 min / 15-60 min / 1-4h / > 4h]
```

**Effort scale:**
- **Low:** Localized change, single file, no tests needed
- **Medium:** Multiple files, straightforward, may need test updates
- **High:** Significant refactoring, new tests, multiple modules affected
- **Very high:** Architectural change, many files, extensive testing, risk of regressions


### Finding Presentation (Unified Model)
All cycle review skills follow this pattern:
1. Collect findings from agents/tools
2. Consolidate and deduplicate
3. **Group same-nature findings** — after deduplication, identify findings that share the
   same root cause or fix pattern (e.g., "missing error handling" in 5 handlers, "inconsistent
   import path" in 4 files). If 2+ findings are of the same nature, merge them into a **single
   grouped entry** listing all affected files/locations. Each group counts as ONE item in the
   `"(X/N)"` sequence. The user makes ONE decision for the entire group.
4. Announce total findings count: `"### Total findings to review: N"` (where N reflects
   grouped entries — a group of 5 same-nature findings counts as 1)
5. Present overview table with severity counts
6. **Deep research BEFORE presenting each finding** (see research checklist below)
7. Walk through findings ONE AT A TIME with `"(X/N)"` progress prefix in the header, ordered by severity
   (CRITICAL first, then HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW). **ALL findings MUST be presented regardless of
   severity** — the agent NEVER skips, filters, or auto-resolves any finding. The decision to
   fix or skip is ALWAYS the user's. For grouped entries, list all affected files/locations
   within the single presentation.
8. For each finding: present research-backed analysis + options, collect decision via AskUser.
   **Every AskUser for a finding decision MUST include these options:**
   - One option per proposed solution (Option A, Option B, Option C, etc.)
   - Skip — no action
   - Tell me more — if selected, STOP and answer immediately (do NOT continue to next finding)
   **AskUser `[topic]` format:** Format: `(X/N) F#-Category`.
   Example: `[topic] (8/12) F8-DeadCode`.
9. **IMMEDIATE RESPONSE RULE — If the user selects "Tell me more" OR responds with free text
   (a question, disagreement, or request for clarification) instead of a decision:**
   **STOP IMMEDIATELY.** Do NOT continue to the next finding. Do NOT batch the response.
   Research the user's concern RIGHT NOW using `WebSearch`, codebase analysis, or both.
   Provide a thorough answer with evidence (links, code references, best practice citations).
   Only AFTER the user is satisfied, re-present the options and ask for their decision again.
   This may go back and forth multiple times — that is expected and correct behavior.
   **NEVER defer the response to the end of the findings loop.**
10. After ALL N decisions collected: apply ALL approved fixes (see below)
11. Run verification (see Verification Timing below)
12. Present final summary


### Protocol: Active Version Guard

**Referenced by:** all stage agents (1-4)

After the task ID is confirmed and dependencies are validated, check if the task belongs
to the `Ativa` version. If not, present options before proceeding.

1. Read the task's **Version** column from `tasks.md`
2. Read the **Versions** table and find the version with Status `Ativa`
   - **If no version has Status `Ativa`** → **STOP**: "No active version found in the Versions table. Run `/optimus-tasks` to set a version as Ativa before proceeding."
3. **If the task's version matches the `Ativa` version** → proceed silently
4. **If the task's version does NOT match the `Ativa` version** → present via `AskUser`:
   ```
   Task T-XXX is in version '<task_version>' (<version_status>),
   but the active version is '<active_version>'.
   To execute this task, it must be moved to the active version first.
   ```
   Options:
   - **Move to active version and continue** — updates the Version column to the active version, commits, and proceeds
   - **Cancel** — stops execution

5. **If "Move to active version and continue":**
   - Update the task's Version column in `tasks.md` to the `Ativa` version name
   - Commit:
     ```bash
     git add "$TASKS_FILE"
     COMMIT_MSG_FILE=$(mktemp)
     printf '%s' "chore(tasks): move T-XXX to active version <active_version>" > "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE"
     git commit -F "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE"
     rm -f "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE"
     ```
   - Proceed with the stage

6. **If "Cancel":** **STOP** — do not proceed with the stage

Skills reference this as: "Check active version guard — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Active Version Guard."


### Protocol: Branch Name Derivation

**Referenced by:** plan, build, review, pr-check, done (workspace auto-navigation)

Branch names are derived deterministically from the task's structural data in tasks.md.
They are NOT stored in tasks.md — they are stored in state.json for quick reference
and can always be re-derived.

**Derivation rule:**

```
<tipo-prefix>/<task-id-lowercase>-<keywords>
```

Where:
- `<tipo-prefix>` is mapped from the Tipo column: Feature→`feat`, Fix→`fix`,
  Refactor→`refactor`, Chore→`chore`, Docs→`docs`, Test→`test`
- `<task-id-lowercase>` is the task ID in lowercase (e.g., `t-003`)
- `<keywords>` are 2-4 lowercase words from the Title, stripping articles,
  prepositions, and generic words (implement, add, create, update)

**Sanitization (applied to keywords before constructing branch name):**
1. Convert to lowercase
2. Replace non-alphanumeric characters (except hyphens) with hyphens
3. Collapse consecutive hyphens to a single hyphen
4. Remove leading/trailing hyphens from each keyword
5. Truncate the full branch name to 100 characters

**Examples:**
- T-003 "User Auth JWT" (Feature) → `feat/t-003-user-auth-jwt`
- T-007 "Duplicate Login" (Fix) → `fix/t-007-duplicate-login`
- T-012 "Extract Middleware" (Refactor) → `refactor/t-012-extract-middleware`
- T-015 "User Auth: JWT/OAuth2 Support" (Feature) → `feat/t-015-user-auth-jwt-oauth2-support`

**Resolution order when looking for a task's branch:**
1. Read `branch` from state.json (fastest)
2. Search by task ID: `git branch --list "*<task-id>*"` or `git worktree list | grep -iF "<task-id>"`
3. Derive from Tipo + ID + Title (always works)

Skills reference this as: "Derive branch name — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Branch Name Derivation."


### Protocol: Divergence Warning

**Referenced by:** all stage agents (1-4)

Since status and branch data live in state.json (gitignored), tasks.md rarely changes
on feature branches. This protocol detects the uncommon case where tasks.md WAS modified
(e.g., Active Version Guard moved a task).

```bash
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')
if [ -z "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" ]; then
  DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git branch --list main master 2>/dev/null | head -1 | tr -d ' *')
fi
if [ -z "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" ]; then
  echo "WARNING: Cannot determine default branch. Skipping divergence check."
  # Skip — this is a warning, not a HARD BLOCK
else
  TASKS_FILE=".optimus/tasks.md"
  if ! git fetch origin "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" --quiet 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "WARNING: Could not fetch from origin. Divergence check may use stale data."
  fi
  git diff "origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH" -- "$TASKS_FILE" 2>/dev/null | head -20
fi
```

- If diff output is non-empty → warn via `AskUser`:
  ```
  tasks.md has diverged between your branch and <default_branch>.
  This may cause merge conflicts when the PR is merged.
  ```
  Options:
  - **Sync now** — run `git merge origin/<default_branch>` to incorporate changes
  - **Continue without syncing** — I'll handle conflicts later
- If diff output is empty → proceed silently (files are in sync)
- **NOTE:** This is a warning, not a HARD BLOCK. The user may choose to continue.

Skills reference this as: "Check tasks.md divergence — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Divergence Warning."


### Protocol: GitHub CLI Check (HARD BLOCK)

**Referenced by:** all stage agents (1-4), tasks, batch

```bash
gh auth status 2>/dev/null
```

If this command fails (exit code != 0), **STOP** immediately:
```
GitHub CLI (gh) is not authenticated. Run `gh auth login` to authenticate before proceeding.
```


### Protocol: Increment Stage Stats

**Referenced by:** plan, review

After the status change in state.json (and BEFORE any analysis work begins), increment
the execution counter for the current stage in `.optimus/stats.json`. This tracks how many
times each stage ran on each task — useful for spotting spec churn and review cycles.

**NOTE:** Only increment when NOT in dry-run mode.

1. Read `.optimus/stats.json`. If the file does not exist, start with an empty object `{}`.
   If the file exists but is corrupted, reset it:
   ```bash
   STATS_FILE=".optimus/stats.json"
   if [ -f "$STATS_FILE" ] && ! jq empty "$STATS_FILE" 2>/dev/null; then
     echo "WARNING: stats.json is corrupted. Resetting counters."
     echo '{}' > "$STATS_FILE"
   fi
   ```
2. If the task ID key does not exist, initialize it:
   ```json
   { "plan_runs": 0, "review_runs": 0 }
   ```
3. Increment the appropriate counter (`plan_runs` for plan, `review_runs` for review).
4. Set the timestamp field (`last_plan` or `last_review`) to the current UTC ISO 8601 time.
5. Write the updated JSON back to `.optimus/stats.json` (pretty-printed, sorted keys).

**NOTE:** stats.json is gitignored — no commit needed.

Skills reference this as: "Increment stage stats — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Increment Stage Stats."


### Protocol: Notification Hooks

**Referenced by:** all stage agents (1-4), tasks

After writing a status change to state.json, invoke notification hooks if present.

**IMPORTANT — Capture timing:** Read the current status from state.json and store it as
`OLD_STATUS` BEFORE writing the new status. The sequence is:
1. Read current status: `OLD_STATUS=$(jq -r --arg id "$TASK_ID" '.[$id].status // "Pendente"' "$STATE_FILE")`
2. Write new status to state.json
3. Invoke hooks with `OLD_STATUS` and new status

**IMPORTANT:** Always quote all arguments and sanitize user-derived values to prevent
shell injection. Hook scripts MUST NOT pass their arguments to `eval` or shell
interpretation — treat all arguments as untrusted data.

```bash
_optimus_sanitize() { printf '%s' "$1" | tr -cd '[:alnum:][:space:]-_./:'; }
HOOKS_FILE=$(test -f ./tasks-hooks.sh && echo ./tasks-hooks.sh || (test -f ./docs/tasks-hooks.sh && echo ./docs/tasks-hooks.sh))
if [ -n "$HOOKS_FILE" ] && [ -x "$HOOKS_FILE" ]; then
  "$HOOKS_FILE" "$(_optimus_sanitize "$event")" "$(_optimus_sanitize "$task_id")" "$(_optimus_sanitize "$old_status")" "$(_optimus_sanitize "$new_status")" 2>/dev/null &
fi
```

Events and their parameter signatures:

| Event | Parameters | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `status-change` | `event task_id old_status new_status` | Any status transition |
| `task-done` | `event task_id old_status "DONE"` | Task marked as done |
| `task-cancelled` | `event task_id old_status "Cancelado"` | Task cancelled |
| `task-blocked` | `event task_id current_status current_status reason` | Dependency check failed (5 args — includes reason) |

When a dependency check fails:
```bash
if [ -n "$HOOKS_FILE" ] && [ -x "$HOOKS_FILE" ]; then
  "$HOOKS_FILE" "task-blocked" "$(_optimus_sanitize "$task_id")" "$(_optimus_sanitize "$current_status")" "$(_optimus_sanitize "$current_status")" "$(_optimus_sanitize "blocked by $dep_id ($dep_status)")" 2>/dev/null &
fi
```

Hooks run in background (`&`) and their failure does NOT block the pipeline.
If `tasks-hooks.sh` does not exist, hooks are silently skipped.

### Protocol: Per-Droid Quality Checklists

**Referenced by:** review, pr-check, deep-review, coderabbit-review, plan, build

Each droid type has specific dimensions it MUST verify beyond its core domain. Skills
that dispatch review droids MUST include the applicable checklists in agent prompts.

**Code Quality agent** (`ring-default-code-reviewer`) must additionally verify:
- Resilience: external calls have timeout, retry with backoff, circuit breaker where appropriate
- Resource lifecycle: all opened connections/handles are closed (defer, cleanup, graceful shutdown)
- Concurrency: shared state has proper synchronization, no goroutine leaks, no deadlock risk
- Performance: no N+1 queries, no unbounded queries, indexes exist for query patterns, no hot-path allocations
- Configuration: no hardcoded values that should be environment-configurable, safe defaults
- Cognitive complexity: functions with >3 nesting levels or >30 lines flagged for decomposition
- Error handling: errors wrapped with context, consistent with codebase error patterns
- Domain purity: no infrastructure concerns in domain layer, dependency direction correct
- Resource leaks: DB connections, HTTP clients, file handles, channels properly closed

**Business Logic agent** (`ring-default-business-logic-reviewer`) must additionally verify:
- Spec traceability: each code path maps to a spec requirement (flag orphan logic with no spec backing)
- Data integrity: transaction boundaries correct, partial writes impossible, rollback defined
- Backward compatibility: existing consumers/contracts not broken by this change
- API semantics: correct HTTP status codes, idempotent operations marked as such, pagination consistent
- Domain edge cases: what happens with zero, negative, maximum, duplicate, concurrent values?
- Business rule completeness: all business rules from spec have implementation AND test

**Security agent** (`ring-default-security-reviewer`) must additionally verify:
- Data privacy: PII not logged, sensitive fields masked in responses, LGPD/GDPR compliance
- Error responses: no internal details leaked (stack traces, DB schemas, internal paths, SQL)
- Rate limiting: high-throughput or public endpoints have rate limiting consideration
- Input validation: happens at the right layer (not just client-side), consistent with codebase
- Secrets: no hardcoded credentials, tokens, API keys in code or config files
- Auth propagation: authentication context properly propagated through the call chain

**Test Quality agent** (`ring-default-ring-test-reviewer`) must additionally verify:
- Test effectiveness: do tests verify BEHAVIOR or just mock internals? Flag tests where assertions only check mock.Called() without verifying output/state
- False positive risk: could these tests pass while the feature is actually broken?
- Test coupling: are tests coupled to implementation details (private fields, internal struct layout)?
- Spec traceability: for each acceptance criterion in the task spec, is there a test?
- Integration tests: do they use real dependencies (testcontainers/docker) or just mocks?
- Test isolation: can tests run in parallel without interference? Shared state between tests?
- Error scenario completeness: each error return path has a corresponding test?
- Boundary values: min, max, zero, empty, nil, negative tested where applicable?

**Nil/Null Safety agent** (`ring-default-ring-nil-safety-reviewer`) must additionally verify:
- Resource cleanup: nil checks before Close/Release calls
- Channel safety: sends to nil/closed channels
- Map safety: reads/writes to nil maps
- Slice safety: index bounds after filtering/transforming

**Ripple Effects agent** (`ring-default-ring-consequences-reviewer`) must additionally verify:
- Values duplicated between files that should be a shared constant
- Imports follow the project's layer architecture (no circular deps, no backwards imports)
- New code follows the same patterns as existing code in the same domain
- Backward compatibility: does this change break any existing consumer or API contract?
- Configuration drift: new defaults reasonable? existing config overrides still valid?
- Migration path: if breaking change, is migration strategy documented?
- Shared state: new global/package-level state that could cause issues across modules?
- Event/message contracts: changes to event payloads affect downstream consumers?

**Dead Code agent** (`ring-default-ring-dead-code-reviewer`) must additionally verify:
- Dead code: unused imports, unreachable branches, commented-out code
- Zombie test infrastructure: test helpers, fixtures, mocks no longer used by any test
- Feature flags: stale feature flag checks for flags that were already fully rolled out
- Deprecated paths: code paths behind deprecated API versions with no remaining consumers

**Spec Compliance / QA agent** (`ring-dev-team-qa-analyst`) must additionally verify:
- Testability assessment: is the code structured for testability? (dependency injection, interfaces)
- Operational readiness: can ops monitor, debug, and rollback this in production?
- Acceptance criteria coverage: each AC has both success AND failure test scenarios
- Cross-cutting scenarios: concurrent modifications, large datasets, special characters, timezone handling

**Frontend specialist** (`ring-dev-team-frontend-engineer`) must additionally verify:
- UX completeness: loading states, empty states, error states all handled
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, screen reader support, ARIA labels, color contrast
- Responsive behavior: works across viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- i18n readiness: no hardcoded user-facing strings, date/number formatting locale-aware
- Performance: no unnecessary re-renders, large lists virtualized, images optimized

**Backend specialist** (`ring-dev-team-backend-engineer-golang` or TS equivalent) must additionally verify:
- Language idiomaticity: follows official style guide conventions
- Graceful shutdown: SIGTERM handling, in-flight request draining
- Connection pool sizing: appropriate for expected load
- Context propagation: request context passed through the full call chain
- Structured logging: logs include correlation IDs, operation names, durations

Skills reference this as: "Include per-droid quality checklists — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Per-Droid Quality Checklists."


### Protocol: Project Rules Discovery

**Referenced by:** stages 1-4, deep-review, coderabbit-review

Every skill that reviews, validates, or generates code MUST search for project rules
and AI instruction files before starting. Search for these files in order and read ALL
that exist:

```
AGENTS.md                    # Primary agent instructions
CLAUDE.md                    # Claude-specific rules
DROIDS.md                    # Droid-specific rules
.cursorrules                 # Cursor-specific rules
PROJECT_RULES.md             # Coding standards (root or docs/)
docs/PROJECT_RULES.md
.editorconfig                # Editor formatting rules
docs/coding-standards.md     # Explicit coding conventions
docs/conventions.md
.github/CONTRIBUTING.md      # Contribution guidelines
CONTRIBUTING.md
.eslintrc*                   # Linter configs (implicit rules)
biome.json
.golangci.yml
.prettierrc*
```

If NONE exist, warn the user. If any are found, they become the source of truth
for coding standards and must be passed to every dispatched sub-agent.

Skills reference this as: "Discover project rules — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Project Rules Discovery."


### Protocol: Push Commits (optional)

**Referenced by:** plan, build, review, coderabbit-review. Note: done handles pushing inline in its own cleanup phase. pr-check and deep-review have their own push phases.

After stage work is complete, offer to push all local commits:

**Step 1 — Check if upstream tracking exists:**

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{u} 2>/dev/null
```

- **If command fails (no upstream):** The branch was never pushed. All local commits are unpushed.
  Ask via `AskUser`:
  ```
  Branch has no upstream (never pushed). Push now?
  ```
  Options:
  - **Push now** — `git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"`
  - **Skip** — I'll push manually later

- **If command succeeds (upstream exists):** Check for unpushed commits:
  ```bash
  git log @{u}..HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null
  ```
  If there are unpushed commits, ask via `AskUser`:
  ```
  There are N unpushed commits on this branch. Push now?
  ```
  Options:
  - **Push now** — `git push`
  - **Skip** — I'll push manually later

**Why check upstream first:** `git log @{u}..HEAD` silently produces empty output when no
upstream exists, making it appear there's nothing to push. Without this check, the push step
would be silently skipped even though ALL local commits are unpushed.

**After a successful push**, check if the current repo is the Optimus plugin repository
and update installed plugins to pick up the changes just pushed:

```bash
if jq -e '.name == "optimus"' .factory-plugin/marketplace.json >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Optimus repo detected — updating installed plugins..."
  for skill in $(droid plugin list 2>/dev/null | grep optimus | awk '{print $1}'); do
    droid plugin update "$skill" 2>/dev/null
  done
fi
```

This ensures that agents running in the Optimus repo itself always use the latest
skill versions after pushing changes.

Skills reference this as: "Offer to push commits — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Push Commits."


### Protocol: Re-run Guard

**Referenced by:** plan, review

After the convergence loop exits and the final report/summary is presented, evaluate
whether to suggest advancement or offer a re-run. This protocol replaces the static
"Next step suggestion" in plan and review.

**Logic:**

1. Count `total_findings` produced during this execution (all findings from round 1 AND
   all subsequent convergence rounds, from all agents and static analysis — regardless of
   whether they were fixed or skipped by the user). If findings were grouped (per Finding
   Presentation item 3), count grouped entries, not individual occurrences.
2. **If `total_findings == 0`:** The analysis is clean. Suggest the next stage:
   - plan: "Spec validation clean — 0 findings. Next step: run `/optimus-build` to implement this task."
   - review: "Implementation review clean — 0 findings. Next step: run `/optimus-done` to close this task."
3. **If `total_findings > 0`:** Ask via `AskUser`:
   ```
   Validation found N findings (X fixed, Y skipped).
   Re-running dispatches ALL review agents again with clean context (no memory of
   previous findings — findings you previously skipped will reappear for review).
   This will consume similar tokens to the initial run. Workspace and status are preserved.
   ```
   Options:
   - **Re-run with clean context** — re-analyze from scratch
   - **Advance to next stage** — proceed despite findings

4. **If "Re-run with clean context":**
   - Increment stage stats (new execution)
   - **Skip:** GitHub CLI check, tasks.md validation, task identification, session state
     check, status validation/change, workspace creation, divergence check
   - **Re-execute:** project structure discovery, document loading, static analysis,
     coverage profiling, agent dispatch (ALL agents), finding presentation, fix application,
     convergence loop
   - **Session file:** After re-run starts, the session protocol (Protocol: Session State)
     resumes normal operation — update the session file at each phase transition as usual.
     This ensures crash recovery during a re-run resumes from the correct phase.
   - After the re-run completes, apply this protocol again (evaluate findings count)
   - There is no limit on re-runs — the user controls when to stop

5. **If "Advance to next stage":** Proceed to push commits and present the next step suggestion.

**NOTE:** "0 findings" means the analysis produced zero findings — not that all findings
were resolved. If the user skipped findings in a previous run, they will reappear on
re-run (clean context has no memory of previous decisions). This is by design.

**NOTE:** Re-run analyzes the current codebase state, including any fixes applied and
committed during the previous run. It does NOT revert commits. This validates that
applied fixes are correct and checks for any issues introduced by the fixes.

Skills reference this as: "Execute re-run guard — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Re-run Guard."


### Protocol: Ring Droid Requirement Check

**Referenced by:** review, pr-check, deep-doc-review, coderabbit-review, plan, build

Before dispatching ring droids, verify the required droids are available. If any required
droid is not installed, **STOP** and list missing droids.

**Core review droids** (required by review, pr-check, deep-review, coderabbit-review):
- `ring-default-code-reviewer`
- `ring-default-business-logic-reviewer`
- `ring-default-security-reviewer`
- `ring-default-ring-test-reviewer`

**Extended review droids** (required by review, pr-check, deep-review, coderabbit-review):
- `ring-default-ring-nil-safety-reviewer`
- `ring-default-ring-consequences-reviewer`
- `ring-default-ring-dead-code-reviewer`

**QA droids** (required by review, deep-review, build):
- `ring-dev-team-qa-analyst`

**Documentation droids** (required by deep-doc-review):
- `ring-tw-team-docs-reviewer`
- `ring-default-business-logic-reviewer`
- `ring-default-code-reviewer`

**Implementation droids** (required by build):
- `ring-dev-team-backend-engineer-golang` (Go)
- `ring-dev-team-backend-engineer-typescript` (TypeScript)
- `ring-dev-team-frontend-engineer` (React/Next.js)

**Spec validation droids** (required by plan):
- `ring-default-business-logic-reviewer`
- `ring-default-security-reviewer`
- `ring-dev-team-qa-analyst`
- `ring-default-code-reviewer`

Skills reference this as: "Verify ring droids — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Ring Droid Requirement Check."


### Protocol: Session State

**Referenced by:** all stage agents (1-4)

Stage agents write a session state file to track progress. This enables resumption
when a session is interrupted (agent crash, user closes terminal, context window limit).

**IMPORTANT — Write timing:** The session file MUST be written **immediately after the
status change in state.json** (before any work begins). This ensures crash recovery has
a record even if the agent fails before producing any output. Do NOT wait until
"key phase transitions" to write the initial session file.

**Session file location:** `.optimus/sessions/session-<task-id>.json` (gitignored).
Each task gets its own file (e.g., `.optimus/sessions/session-T-003.json`).

```json
{
  "task_id": "T-003",
  "stage": "<stage-name>",
  "status": "<stage-output-status>",
  "branch": "feat/t-003-user-auth",
  "started_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-01-15T11:45:00Z",
  "phase": "Phase 1: Implementation",
  "convergence_round": 0,
  "findings_count": 0,
  "notes": "Implementation in progress"
}
```

**Convergence checkpoint:** During the convergence loop, update `convergence_round` and
`findings_count` after each round completes. On resume, skip to the last completed round
rather than restarting the entire analysis.

**On stage start (after task ID is known):**

```bash
SESSION_FILE=".optimus/sessions/session-${TASK_ID}.json"
if [ -f "$SESSION_FILE" ]; then
  if ! jq empty "$SESSION_FILE" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "WARNING: Session file is corrupted. Deleting and proceeding fresh."
    rm -f "$SESSION_FILE"
  else
    cat "$SESSION_FILE"
  fi
fi
```

- If the file exists AND the task's status in `state.json` matches the session's `status`:
  - Present via `AskUser`:
    ```
    Previous session found:
      Task: T-XXX — [title]
      Stage: <stage-name>
      Last active: <time since updated_at>
      Progress: <phase from session>
    Resume this session?
    ```
    Options: Resume / Start fresh (delete session) / Continue (keep session file)
  - If **Resume**: skip to the phase indicated in the session file
  - If **Start fresh (delete session)**: delete the session file and proceed from the beginning
  - If **Continue (keep session file)**: proceed from the beginning without deleting the session file
- If the file is stale (>24h) or the task status has changed → delete and proceed normally.
  **Staleness check example:**
  ```bash
  UPDATED=$(jq -r '.updated_at // empty' "$SESSION_FILE" 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -n "$UPDATED" ]; then
    NOW_EPOCH=$(date +%s)
    if [ "$(uname)" = "Darwin" ]; then
      UPDATED_EPOCH=$(date -j -f "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ" "$UPDATED" +%s 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
    else
      UPDATED_EPOCH=$(date -d "$UPDATED" +%s 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
    fi
    AGE=$(( NOW_EPOCH - UPDATED_EPOCH ))
    if [ "$AGE" -gt 86400 ]; then
      echo "Session file is stale (>24h). Deleting."
      rm -f "$SESSION_FILE"
    fi
  fi
  ```
- **External status change detection:** If the session file exists AND the task's status
  does NOT match the session's `status`, check if the difference is explainable by normal
  stage progression (e.g., session says `Em Andamento` but task is now `Validando Impl` —
  the task was advanced externally via `/optimus-tasks`). If the status change is NOT
  explainable by forward progression, treat the session as stale and delete it.
- If no file exists → proceed normally

**On stage progress (at key phase transitions):**

```bash
# Initialize .optimus directory — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Initialize .optimus Directory.
mkdir -p .optimus/sessions .optimus/reports
BRANCH_NAME=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "detached")
jq -n \
  --arg task_id "${TASK_ID}" --arg stage "<stage-name>" --arg status "<status>" \
  --arg branch "${BRANCH_NAME}" --arg started "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  --arg updated "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --arg phase "<current-phase>" \
  --arg notes "<progress>" \
  '{task_id: $task_id, stage: $stage, status: $status, branch: $branch,
    started_at: $started, updated_at: $updated, phase: $phase, notes: $notes}' \
  > ".optimus/sessions/session-${TASK_ID}.json"
```

**On stage completion:** Delete the session file:
```bash
rm -f ".optimus/sessions/session-${TASK_ID}.json"
```

Skills reference this as: "Execute session state protocol from AGENTS.md using stage=`<name>`, status=`<status>`."


### Protocol: Shell Safety Guidelines

**Referenced by:** plan, batch

All bash examples in AGENTS.md and SKILL.md files are templates that agents execute literally.
Follow these rules to prevent injection and silent failures:

1. **Always quote variables:** Use `"$VAR"` not `$VAR` — especially for paths, branch names, and user-derived values
2. **Check exit codes for critical commands:**
   ```bash
   git add "$TASKS_FILE"
   COMMIT_MSG_FILE=$(mktemp)
   printf '%s' "chore(tasks): $COMMIT_MSG" > "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE"
   if ! git commit -F "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE"; then
     echo "ERROR: git commit failed. Check pre-commit hooks or git config."
     rm -f "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE"
     # STOP — do not proceed
   fi
   rm -f "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE"
   ```
3. **Never interpolate user-derived values directly into shell commands** — task titles,
   branch names, and other user input may contain shell metacharacters
4. **Use `grep -F` for fixed string matching** — never pass branch names or task IDs
   as regex patterns to `grep` without `-F`
5. **Use `grep -E '^\| T-NNN \|'`** to match task rows in tasks.md — plain `grep "T-NNN"`
   matches titles and dependency columns too
6. **Validate tool availability** before use: `command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1` before running `jq`
7. **Validate JSON files** before parsing: `jq empty "$FILE" 2>/dev/null` before reading keys
8. **Sanitize user-derived values in commit messages** — task titles and descriptions may
   contain shell metacharacters (backticks, `$(...)`, double quotes). **Mandatory pattern:**
   write the commit message to a temporary file and use `git commit -F`:
   ```bash
   COMMIT_MSG_FILE=$(mktemp)
   printf '%s' "chore(tasks): $OPERATION" > "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE"
   git commit -F "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE"
   rm -f "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE"
   ```
   This avoids all shell expansion issues. If using `-m` directly, sanitize with:
   `SAFE_VALUE=$(printf '%s' "$VALUE" | tr -d '`$')` before interpolation.

Skills reference this as: "Follow shell safety guidelines — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Shell Safety Guidelines."


### Protocol: State Management

**Referenced by:** all stage agents (1-4), tasks, report, quick-report, import, batch

All status and branch data is stored in `.optimus/state.json` (gitignored).

**Prerequisites:**

```bash
if ! command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "ERROR: jq is required for state management but not installed."
  # STOP — do not proceed
fi
```

**Reading state:**

```bash
STATE_FILE=".optimus/state.json"
if [ -f "$STATE_FILE" ]; then
  # Validate JSON integrity before reading
  if ! jq empty "$STATE_FILE" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "WARNING: state.json is corrupted. Running reconciliation."
    rm -f "$STATE_FILE"
    # Fall through to missing-file handling below
  fi
fi
# One-time migration: Revisando PR → Validando Impl (status removed)
if [ -f "$STATE_FILE" ] && jq -e 'to_entries[] | select(.value.status == "Revisando PR")' "$STATE_FILE" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  jq 'with_entries(if .value.status == "Revisando PR" then .value.status = "Validando Impl" else . end)' "$STATE_FILE" > "${STATE_FILE}.tmp" \
    && mv "${STATE_FILE}.tmp" "$STATE_FILE"
  echo "NOTE: Migrated tasks from 'Revisando PR' to 'Validando Impl' (status removed in this version)."
fi
if [ -f "$STATE_FILE" ]; then
  TASK_STATUS=$(jq -r --arg id "$TASK_ID" '.[$id].status // "Pendente"' "$STATE_FILE")
  TASK_BRANCH=$(jq -r --arg id "$TASK_ID" '.[$id].branch // ""' "$STATE_FILE")
else
  TASK_STATUS="Pendente"
  TASK_BRANCH=""
fi
```

A task with no entry in state.json is implicitly `Pendente`.

**Writing state:**

```bash
# Initialize .optimus directory — see AGENTS.md Protocol: Initialize .optimus Directory.
STATE_FILE=".optimus/state.json"
if [ ! -f "$STATE_FILE" ]; then
  echo '{}' > "$STATE_FILE"
fi
if [ -z "$TASK_ID" ] || [ -z "$NEW_STATUS" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Cannot write state — TASK_ID or NEW_STATUS is empty."
  # STOP — do not proceed
fi
UPDATED_AT=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
if jq --arg id "$TASK_ID" --arg status "$NEW_STATUS" --arg branch "$BRANCH_NAME" --arg ts "$UPDATED_AT" \
  '.[$id] = {status: $status, branch: $branch, updated_at: $ts}' "$STATE_FILE" > "${STATE_FILE}.tmp"; then
  if jq empty "${STATE_FILE}.tmp" 2>/dev/null; then
    mv "${STATE_FILE}.tmp" "$STATE_FILE"
  else
    rm -f "${STATE_FILE}.tmp"
    echo "ERROR: jq produced invalid JSON — state.json unchanged"
    # STOP — do not proceed
  fi
else
  rm -f "${STATE_FILE}.tmp"
  echo "ERROR: jq failed to update state.json"
  # STOP — do not proceed
fi
```

**Removing entry (for Pendente reset):**

```bash
STATE_FILE=".optimus/state.json"
if [ ! -f "$STATE_FILE" ]; then
  echo "state.json does not exist — task is already implicitly Pendente."
else
  if jq --arg id "$TASK_ID" 'del(.[$id])' "$STATE_FILE" > "${STATE_FILE}.tmp"; then
    mv "${STATE_FILE}.tmp" "$STATE_FILE"
  else
    rm -f "${STATE_FILE}.tmp"
    echo "ERROR: jq failed to update state.json"
  fi
fi
```

**Listing all tasks with status (for report/quick-report):**

```bash
STATE_FILE=".optimus/state.json"
TASKS_FILE=".optimus/tasks.md"
# Validate state.json if it exists
if [ -f "$STATE_FILE" ] && ! jq empty "$STATE_FILE" 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "WARNING: state.json is corrupted. Treating all tasks as Pendente."
  rm -f "$STATE_FILE"
fi
# Get all task IDs from tasks.md
TASK_IDS=$(grep -E '^\| T-[0-9]+ \|' "$TASKS_FILE" | awk -F'|' '{print $2}' | tr -d ' ')
# For each task, read status from state.json (default: Pendente)
for TASK_ID in $TASK_IDS; do
  if [ -f "$STATE_FILE" ]; then
    STATUS=$(jq -r --arg id "$TASK_ID" '.[$id].status // "Pendente"' "$STATE_FILE")
  else
    STATUS="Pendente"
  fi
  echo "$TASK_ID: $STATUS"
done
```

**state.json is NEVER committed.** It is gitignored. No `git add` or `git commit`
for state changes.

**Reconciliation (if state.json is lost or empty):**
1. List all worktrees: `git worktree list`
2. For each worktree matching a task ID pattern (e.g., `t-003` in the path),
   infer status as `Em Andamento` (most common in-progress status)
3. Tasks without worktrees are `Pendente`
4. Ask the user to confirm before proceeding

**Automatic mismatch detection:** Stage agents SHOULD check for inconsistencies on startup:
if state.json is missing or empty AND worktrees exist for known task IDs, warn the user
and offer to run reconciliation before proceeding. This prevents tasks from silently
appearing as `Pendente` when they actually have active worktrees.

Skills reference this as: "Read/write state.json — see AGENTS.md Protocol: State Management."


### Protocol: TaskSpec Resolution

**Referenced by:** plan, build, review

Resolve the full path to a task's Ring pre-dev spec and its subtasks directory:

1. Read the task's `TaskSpec` column from `tasks.md`
2. If `TaskSpec` is `-` → **STOP**: "Task T-XXX has no Ring pre-dev spec. Link one via `/optimus-tasks` or `/optimus-import`."
3. Resolve full path: `TASK_SPEC_PATH = <TASKS_DIR>/<TaskSpec>`
4. **Path traversal validation (HARD BLOCK):** Verify the resolved path stays within the project:
   ```bash
   PROJECT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   RESOLVED_PATH=$(cd "$PROJECT_ROOT" && realpath -m "${TASKS_DIR}/${TASK_SPEC}" 2>/dev/null \
     || python3 -c "import os,sys; print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))" "${TASKS_DIR}/${TASK_SPEC}" 2>/dev/null)
   if [ -z "$RESOLVED_PATH" ]; then
     echo "ERROR: Cannot resolve TaskSpec path '${TASKS_DIR}/${TASK_SPEC}' — neither realpath nor python3 available."
     exit 1
   fi
   case "$RESOLVED_PATH" in
     "$PROJECT_ROOT"/*) ;; # OK — within project
     *) echo "ERROR: TaskSpec path traversal detected — resolved path is outside the project root."; exit 1 ;;
   esac
   ```
   Also apply the same validation to `TASKS_DIR` when reading from `.optimus/config.json`:
   ```bash
   TASKS_DIR_RESOLVED=$(cd "$PROJECT_ROOT" && realpath -m "$TASKS_DIR" 2>/dev/null \
     || python3 -c "import os,sys; print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))" "$TASKS_DIR" 2>/dev/null)
   if [ -z "$TASKS_DIR_RESOLVED" ]; then
     echo "ERROR: Cannot resolve tasksDir path '$TASKS_DIR'."
     exit 1
   fi
   case "$TASKS_DIR_RESOLVED" in
     "$PROJECT_ROOT"/*) ;; # OK — within project
     *) echo "ERROR: tasksDir path traversal detected — '$TASKS_DIR' resolves outside the project root."; exit 1 ;;
   esac
   ```
5. Read the task spec file at `TASK_SPEC_PATH`
6. Derive subtasks directory: if TaskSpec is `tasks/task_001.md`, subtasks are at `<TASKS_DIR>/subtasks/T-001/`
7. If subtasks directory exists, read all `.md` files inside it

### Protocol: Terminal Identification

**Referenced by:** all stage agents (1-4), batch

After the task ID is identified and confirmed, set the terminal title to show the
current stage and task. This allows users running multiple agents in parallel terminals
to identify each terminal at a glance.

**Set title (after task ID is known):**

```bash
printf '\033]0;optimus: %s | %s — %s\007' "<stage-name>" "$TASK_ID" "$TASK_TITLE"
```

Example output in terminal tab: `optimus: check | T-003 — User Auth JWT`

**Restore title (at stage completion or exit):**

```bash
printf '\033]0;\007'
```

**NOTE:** This uses the standard OSC (Operating System Command) escape sequence
supported by iTerm2, Terminal.app, VS Code terminal, tmux, and most modern terminals.
The sequence is silent — it produces no visible output.

### Protocol: tasks.md Validation (HARD BLOCK)

**Referenced by:** all stage agents (1-4), tasks, batch. Note: resolve performs inline format validation in its own Step 4.2.

Every stage agent MUST validate tasks.md before operating. The full validation rules are
defined in the "Format Validation" section above (items 1-15). This protocol is the
executable version:

1. **Resolve paths:**
   - `TASKS_FILE` is always `.optimus/tasks.md` (fixed path).
   - Read `.optimus/config.json`. If `tasksDir` key exists, use that path. Otherwise, use `docs/pre-dev` (default).
   - Store as `TASKS_FILE` and `TASKS_DIR`.
2. **Find tasks.md:** Check if `TASKS_FILE` exists. If not found, **STOP** and suggest `/optimus-import`.
3. **Validate format:** Execute all 15 validation checks from the "Format Validation" section. If the format marker is missing or any check fails, **STOP** and suggest `/optimus-import`.

**All subsequent references to `tasks.md` in the skill use the resolved `TASKS_FILE` path.
All references to Ring pre-dev artifacts use `TASKS_DIR` as the root** — never hardcoded paths.
